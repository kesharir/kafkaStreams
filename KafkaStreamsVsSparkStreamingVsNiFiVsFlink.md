## KafkaStreams Vs SparkStreaming Vs NiFi Vs Flink: 

- Micro batch vs per data streaming : Spark vs Kafka
- Cluster required vs no cluster required : All vs kafka
- Scales easily by just adding java processes (no re-configuration required)
- Exacltly Once semantics (vs at least once for Spark)
- All code-bases (NiFi is only drag & drop)
