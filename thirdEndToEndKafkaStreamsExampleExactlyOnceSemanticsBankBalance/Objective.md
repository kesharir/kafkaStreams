## BankBalance Practice Now: 

1. ***Create a Kafka Producer*** that outputs ~100 messages per seconds to a topic. Each message
    is random in money (a positive value), and outputs evenly transactions for 6 customers. 
    The data should look like this: 
    ```json
    {
      "Name": "John",
      "amount": 123,
      "time": "2017-07-19T05:24:52"
    }
    ```
   
2. ***Create a Kafka Streams application*** that takes these transactions and will 
   compute the total money in their balance (the balance starts at $0), and the latest time an 
   update was received. 
   As you guessed, the total money is not idempotent (sum), but latest time is (max).

3. Run the producer and Streams applications.

4. There you go, you have an exactly once pipeline!
